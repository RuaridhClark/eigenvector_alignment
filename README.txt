Eigenvector_Alignment

Eigenvector alignment uses the dominant system eigenvectors to assess structural changes in a network. This approach is applied to a dataset, included here as subjects.mat, of 29 subjects from three groups: Alzheimer's Disease, amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Health Control. A two-sample t test is carried out to determine significant structural changes as described in the article "Eigenvector Alignment: assessing functional network changes in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease".

Eig_Align.m - assess eigenvector alignment between a selected node n and all other network nodes, using the system's dominant eigenvectors V.

Ttest_Eig_Align_AMH.m - perform Welch's t test comparing eigenvector alignment between three subject groups, where results are filtered by comparison with random models.

Ttest_Eig_Align_Rand.m - perform Welch's t test comparing eigenvector alignment for each subject group with a set number of random models of functional connectivity matrices.

function [t] = CST(Adj,plot)
% [t] = CST(Adj,plot) is the Cluster Span Threshold, which generates an
% unbiased threshold for an adjacency matrix that is based on a clustering
% coefficient, C, that for a given network balances the number of triples
% that are clustered, forming loops, with those that are spanning, forming
% trees.
